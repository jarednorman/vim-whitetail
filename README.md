# vim-whitetail ðŸ¦Œ

A theme inspired by [vim-detailed](https://github.com/rking/vim-detailed) for
those who prefer a light background.

This theme aims to:

- Make as much use of the 24-bit True Color support as is possible within
  certain parameters (like minimum and maximum contrast.)
- Show as many different syntax units in different colours as possible, showing
  similar syntax units in similar colours.
- Support the extensions and languages that [I](https://github.com/jarednorman)
  use.
